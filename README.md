**From the Topic: Evolutionary Algorithms for Neuromorphic Anomaly Detection**

In this work, I focus on epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders affecting over 50 million people globally. Seizures appear as rare abnomal patterns inside EEG signals, which make a neuromorphic anomaly-detection problem.
My approach targets the automatic real-time recognition of seizure events from brain activity.
